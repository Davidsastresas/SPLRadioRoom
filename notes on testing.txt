20-04-2020 --- SITL to Pi by FTDI working

    Sitl with ftdi connected. The thing is SITL->FTDI ubuntu->FTDI Rpi->Rpi

        sim_vehicle.py -v ArduPlane -f quadplane -A "--uartA=uart:/dev/ttyUSB0" -l 40.422790,-3.375190,10,130  --no-mavproxy

    On this, the .conf file in the Rpi is 115200 baud:

        serial=/dev/ttyUSB0
        serial_speed=115200

20-05-2020 --- Major code architecture change

    Now there are separate src files for air and ground, and the original src is left as it is. Install compiles and installs all
    binaries with their respective .service. Then on each unit run groundunit.service or airunit.service

    Right now it works on both units, with rfd connected to air as well. It works well, only some commands not arrive at first, like
    change wp, sometimes go to guided wp, flight mode. Most time it works great. if rfd directly into ground it works perfectly fine.

    The commands that do not arrive do not arrive to air unit ocassionally, so the trouble is in the receiving part of air unit

    config files are mostly complete for the rest of the development, and all the code basis for the project are there.

    The functionality right now only supports connection to autopilot and transmission by rfd, and then connect to GCS by TCP
